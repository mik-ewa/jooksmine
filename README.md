# jooksmine
First demo version of the application Jooksmine for building a network of friends, communicating with them, and tracking personal activity.

This application is designed to improve my skills as an Android developer, which means the code will evolve and improve over time. I also plan to add features such as progress tracking, viewing the latest activities of friends on your home page, and implementing push notifications for incoming messages.

In addition to these features, the app also includes a weather module. To fully experience Jooksmine, register at https://openweathermap.org/ , generate your API key, and replace the WEATHER_API_KEY value in build.gradle with your own key. However, if you don’t do this, don’t worry—I’ve mocked fake data that will be displayed when API call returns a 401 error.

To open the app on a smartphone, you need to create an account and log in. You don’t have to use your real email address as there is no email verification, so don’t worry—just sign up with random credentials and have fun using Jooksmine!
